# About This Project
In this project I took raw company layoff data dated from 2020-2023 and transformed it in SQL Server for further analysis, this script is attatched as "Company Layoff Data Cleaning.sql".

Once the data was cleaned I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the layoff data in SQL Server, looking for different patterns and coming to conclusions about the data, such as what industries were hit hardest by layoffs following the COVID-19 pandemic, this script is attatched as "Company Layoff Exploratory Data Analysis.sql".

I have provided the raw data as "layoff Data.csv" and the transformed data as "Layoff Data(Cleaned).csv".

Once I had cleaned the data I then converted the cleaned csv to an xlsx file and created a dashboard going into further detail on the layoff data providing a visual representation of the data that is highly customizable, this file has been attatched as "Layoff Data + Dashboard (Cleaned)".
