# About This Project
In this project I took raw company layoff data dated from 2020-2023 and transformed it in SQL Server for further analysis.

Once the data was cleaned I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the layoff data in SQL Server, looking for different patterns and coming to conclusions about the data, such as what industries were hit hardest by layoffs following the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have provided the raw data as "layoff Data.csv" and the transformed data as "Layoff Data(Cleaned).csv".
